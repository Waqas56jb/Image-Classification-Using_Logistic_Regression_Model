# Image Recognition using Logistic Regression 📊
Welcome to my Image Recognition project repository! This project focuses on using Logistic Regression to achieve 96% accuracy in recognizing images based on pixel data.

# Project Overview:
**Objective:**
Implement Logistic Regression for image classification.
**Accuracy:**
Achieved impressive 96% accuracy on test data.
**Libraries Used:**
Python (NumPy 🧮, Pandas 🐼, Matplotlib 📊, Seaborn 🐬, Scikit-learn 🧬).
# Key Features:
**Data Preprocessing:** 
Utilized Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and preprocessing.
**Model Development:**
Implemented Logistic Regression using Scikit-learn.
**Evaluation:** 
Evaluated model performance and achieved high accuracy through thorough testing.
 
**Future Work:**
Experiment with deep learning models for potentially higher accuracy.
Refine preprocessing techniques and explore additional feature engineering.
